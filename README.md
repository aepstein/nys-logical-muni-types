Data set of logical municipal types

These data were extracted from a paper published by the NYS Office of State Comptroller, [Outdated Municipal Structures](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/localgov/pubs/research/munistructures.pdf), published in 2006.  Data were extracted using [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/), and matched to other records providing OSC's [local government entity](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/localgov/datanstat/entitytable.htm) identifiers and NYS Office of Real Property Tax Services [SWIS Code identifiers](http://orpts.tax.ny.gov/cfapps/MuniPro/swis/index.cfm) as provided in the OpenNY [locality hierarchy](https://data.ny.gov/Government-Finance/New-York-State-Locality-Hierarchy-with-Websites/55k6-h6qq) data set.

Posting in case it is helpful to anyone else trying to apply these classifications to analyze other data about these communities statewide.  Note, the original study did not classify all municipalities.
